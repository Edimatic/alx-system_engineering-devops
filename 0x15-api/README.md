#		0x15. API

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

#		Here are some key points about APIs:

Functionality: APIs enable the functionality of one application to be used by another. For instance, a weather app can use a weather service API to get current weather data.

#		Types:

##		Web APIs:
These allow interaction over the web using HTTP/HTTPS. Common types include REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).

##		Library APIs: 
These are provided by software libraries to interact with the functionalities provided by the library.

##		Operating System APIs:
These allow applications to use the operating system's functionalities.

##		RESTful APIs:
REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform actions. They typically use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for data exchange.

##		Endpoints:
 APIs have endpoints, which are specific URLs that applications use to interact with the API. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific function, like fetching user data or posting a comment.

##		Authentication: 
Many APIs require authentication, often using API keys, OAuth tokens, or other methods to ensure that only authorized users can access certain functionalities.

##		Rate Limiting: 
APIs often have rate limits to control the number of requests a user can make in a given time period. This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage.

##		Documentation:
Good APIs come with comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the API, including available endpoints, data formats, authentication methods, and example requests and responses.

In summary, APIs are essential tools for building modern software, enabling interoperability and integration between different systems and services. They are widely used in web development, mobile apps, cloud services, and more.
