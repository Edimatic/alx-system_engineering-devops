			Loops, conditions and parsing

Loops:
Loops are control structures in programming that allow a set of instructions to be repeated multiple times. They are used to iterate over a sequence of statements or a block of code until a certain condition is met. Common types of loops include "for" loops, "while" loops, and "do-while" loops. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures.


Conditions:
Conditions, or conditional statements, are control structures that enable the execution of different code blocks based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. Common conditional statements include "if," "else," and "elif" (else if). Conditions are used to control the flow of a program and make decisions based on certain criteria.


Parsing:
Parsing refers to the process of analyzing a sequence of symbols (such as code or data) to extract meaningful information or to transform it into a structured format. In programming, parsing is commonly used in various contexts, such as:

String Parsing: Breaking down a string into its components or extracting specific information.

Data Parsing: Converting data from one format to another, such as parsing JSON or XML data.

Command-Line Argument Parsing: Extracting and interpreting command-line arguments passed to a program.
