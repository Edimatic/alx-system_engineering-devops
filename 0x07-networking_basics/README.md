					Networking basics

Networking basics refer to fundamental concepts and principles related to computer networking. Computer networking involves the interconnection of multiple devices, such as computers, servers, routers, and switches, to share resources and information. Here are some key networking basics:

Network:

A network is a collection of computers and other devices that are connected together to share resources and information.
Networks can be classified based on their geographical scope: Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), and Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).
Devices in a Network:

Computer/Host: A device that connects to the network to send and receive data.
Router: Connects different networks together and routes data between them.
Switch: Connects devices within the same network and makes decisions about where to send data.
Hub: A basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN.
Protocols:

Networking protocols define a set of rules and conventions for communication between devices on a network. Examples include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
IP Addresses:

IP (Internet Protocol) addresses uniquely identify devices on a network. IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit) are the two major versions.
Subnetting:

Subnetting involves dividing a larger IP network into smaller sub-networks to improve performance, security, and management.
MAC Addresses:

MAC (Media Access Control) addresses are hardware addresses assigned to network interface cards (NICs). They provide a unique identifier for devices on a network.
DNS (Domain Name System):

DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use for communication.
Firewalls:

Firewalls control the flow of network traffic and enforce security policies. They can be hardware or software-based.
Wireless Networking:

Wireless networks use technologies like Wi-Fi to enable devices to connect without physical cables.
LAN and WAN:

LAN (Local Area Network): A network that covers a small geographical area, like an office or a building.
WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that covers a broad area, often connecting LANs across different locations or cities.
OSI Model:

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers, from physical transmission to application.
Understanding these networking basics is crucial for anyone working with computers, IT professionals, and individuals dealing with network-related tasks. It forms the foundation for more advanced networking concepts and technologies.
