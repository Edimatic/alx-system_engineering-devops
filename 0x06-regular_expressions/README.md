				Regular expression

A regular expression, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp," is a powerful and concise way to describe a pattern of characters. It is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, usually used for pattern matching with strings. Regular expressions are widely used in programming, text processing, and data validation.

In a regular expression, you can specify rules for matching strings, such as:

Literal characters: Match specific characters exactly.
Character classes: Match any character from a specified set.
Quantifiers: Specify the number of occurrences of a character or group.
Anchors: Define the position in the string where a match should occur (e.g., the beginning or end of the string).
Groups and capturing: Create subpatterns and capture matched portions of the input.
For example, the regular expression \d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4} represents a pattern for a social security number in the format of three digits, a hyphen, two digits, another hyphen, and four digits.

Regular expressions are supported in many programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, and Perl) and text editors, making them a versatile tool for tasks like searching, matching, and manipulating strings based on specific patterns.
